Here are a few everyday eco-friendly habits that are very easy to incorporate into \nyour day-to-day tasks but can dramatically change the fate of the human race and the environment we live in: 1. Reduced Food Wastage Reduce \nfood waste by not buying extra, not cooking more than required, or stockpiling unnecessarily that will expire easily. 2. Say no to single-use \nplastic The market is flooded with single-use plastic that takes millions of years to degrade and pollutes the environment. Use reusable \nproducts and services instead! 3. Cut down on meat consumption The richer the meat, the greater its carbon emissions in the environment. \nCutting down on meat consumption can make the environment and your gut healthier. 4. Begin a compost pit Place all of your biodegradable \nwaste in a compost pit to maximize its potential as a fertilizer, fuel source, and biodiversity conservation site. 5. Reduce your use of vehicles do \nnot drive or ride your motorcycle to places easily accessible by walking or taking public transportation. This saves money, saves the \nenvironment, and makes you healthier too! 6. Be conscious while using water Though the major portion of the earth is covered with water, very \nlittle of it is suitable for drinking or domestic purposes. This is why we need to be extra cautious while using water. 7. Go for GMO-free foods \nGenetically modified organisms can shake up the biodiversity of a place. Buy only natural and organically grown food items that are safer for \nthe environment. 8. Fuel catalysts save the environment A proven, patented liquid fuel catalyst can help the fuel burn more efficiently and boost \nthe engine's power. This ensures that harmful gasses are not produced while burning the fuel. 9. Get rid of indoor air pollution Pl.ace plants that \nsuck up toxic gasses and open doors and windows daily to dissipate indoor air pollution. 10. Place indoor plants Apart from beautifying the \nambience, indoor plants also produce oxygen and absorb toxic fumes and gasses that can build up due to domestic activities. 11. Keep a check \non the electrical appliances Not only do you need to cut down on the use of electricity but also ensure that the electrical appliances are well-\nworking. Spoiled electrical appliances may consume more electricity. 12. Find eco-friendly cleaners Among your everyday eco-friendly habits, \ncleaning is essential. But cleaning with such chemicals that harm the environment is not right. Make your DIY cleaners or buy eco-friendly \ncleaners for your home. 13. Wooden cutlery is a game-changer Millions of small shops give disposable cutlery made up of non-biodegradable \nmaterials. If all those plastic, Styrofoam, and cling film wraps were replaced by eco-friendly, reusable, or biodegradable materials, we could save \ntons of trash from being generated. 14. Choose non-toxic cosmetics Many cosmetic plants have made a healthier choice by consciously taking \ncare of the environment while producing their products. These eco-friendly beauty products are better for the environment and also much better \nfor your skin. 15. Choose eco-friendly clothes and jewelry Many eco-friendly brands make clothes and jewelry from recycled materials. This \nreduces the demand for raw materials and makes the environment healthier. 16. Carry your mugs Plastic cups for coffee, tea, or other \nbeverages contribute to waste generation. If you can carry a small mug with you, you are saving a large chunk of waste from being generated. \n17. Avoid packaged drinking water Instead, go for recyclable water bottles and keep filling them with fresh filtered water as and when needed. \n18. Use rechargeable batteries-single-use batteries Batteries are often thrown away into the dump yards without being treated. These batteries \ncontain toxic substances that can leak into the land or react with other substances to produce toxic gasses. Rechargeable batteries save us \nfrom this mess. 19. Repair what can be repaired Instead of throwing away things as soon as they break or malfunction, try getting them \nrepaired immediately. This saves money, reduces waste generation, and also suppresses the demand for the production of raw materials. 20. \nDonate If you do not need something that is in usable condition, donate it! This may clear up the clutter for you and benefit the person who \nreceives it. 21. Check your car With age, your car can lose efficiency. Regular servicing keeps your car environmentally friendly and prevents the \nproduction of gases that harm the environment. 22.

Conclusion Going through these points, you must have realized that \nmost of this is what you already know! The truth is, we all know the plight of our environment, and we are all aware of what needs to be done. It \nis just leaping and consciously trying to save the environment. It is not difficult at all, just inculcating simple, eco-friendly habits that can \ndramatically affect the environment and your health for good! 10 green habits to save our planet Posted on November 11, 2018 by Elena \nBragantini Doing an appropriate differentiated waste collection, turning off the lights, moving by bike...represents simple daily actions that is \nintegrated in a every day life routine of very people, can make the difference by contributing to the safeguard of the planet. Here you have the \ngreen habits to adopt to contribute to the safeguard of the planet. Simple everyday actions and ecological expedients that we can adopt at \nhome or even on holiday. Each of them can make the difference and contribute to the safeguard of the hearth. Here 10 green habits that \neveryone of us can adopt at home, at work and on holiday: 1.Do not buy plastic bottles green habits: Do not buy plastic bottles Avoiding the \npurchase of plastic water and use a canteens represent a green choice – picture of Evan Wise on Unsplash The plastic bottles are one the \nbiggest contributor to our landfill. Every minute a million of bottles are used and only the 9% can be recycled. The remain is accumulated in our \nlandfill and often it finishes in the ocean, where according to the experts, in the year 2050 there will be more plastic than fishes. A sustainable \nalternative is to use a canteen while traveling and choose, if possible, the water of the water faucet (that can be purified by using a refiner) and \nprefer the water in glass bottles. 2. Recycle: one of the best green habit green habits: Recycle It might seem ordinary but recycle is fundamental \nfor our environment at home or by traveling. The majority of the cities has now a system of recycle but if your city or the place in which you are \nspending your holidays doesn’t practice the differentiated waste collection...then you can begin! And do not forget to teach it even to the \nchildren. According to the Legambiente esteems, by recycling the half of the garbage, we reduce the C02 and the polluted gas in the \natmosphere of a quantity between the 150 and 200 kilogram per year. 3. Plant a tree green habits: Plant a tree Planting a tree in your garden is \none of the best way to reduce the air pollution. The trees absorb the carbon diopside and produce oxygen, by improving the air of the cities with \npositive effects on the health. More trees means cleaner air. 4. Save water green habits: Save water Picture of Pan Xiaozhen on Unsplash The \nwater is a precious good that is unfortunately limited but thanks to technology of today, it is possible to purify it and to reuse it. Not only having \na shorter shower and close the water faucet while brushing the teeth.With small efforts you can adopt some simple expedited to reduce the \nconsumption of this precious good. As installing with a small expense a water flow restrictors for our faucet, reducing the flow of water and \nsaving approximately the 50% of the water. 5. Save energy green habits: Save energy In order to avoid the waste and excessive consumption of \nenergy, why do not install in your home the LED energy saving light bulb ? A small investment useful to safeguard the planet, that will lower your \nbills. In fact the energy saving lights consumes the 75% less of energy of the traditional lights. Moreover, at home or in holiday in your eco-\nfriendly chalet remember to always turn off the lights and to switch off all the devices and appliances. 6. Choose the self production green \nhabits: Choose the self production Even cook and produce home made past is a green choice – Picture of Rawpixel via Unsplash. Home made \nfood, natural soaps, preserves, jams, body creams or infusions...the self production is one of the fundamental choices to save and live in a more \nsustainable way.

Some times we \nneed just a few simple ingredients to produce at home what we need. An example? You can produce ecological and natural cleanings by using \nthe lemon, vinegar and the skins of the oranges. 7. Choose the sustainable mobility green habits: Choose the sustainable mobility Bike sharing \n– Picture of VizAforMemories via Unsplash To avoid your carbon foot print, choose the train rather than the car, avoid the cruises and when you \ncan try to move by bicycle. It is always better to choose the public means of transport to move, in order to improve the air pollution. But when it \nis not possible then try to organize or participate to a carpooling! Your movements will be green and funny and you will have the chance to know \nnew people. 8. Be careful of the expense green habits: Be careful of the expense Farmer’s market – picture of Peter Wendt via Unsplash In the \nWestern countries, approximately 670 millions of packaged food are thrown away every year. It means more than 95 kilos per year per person. \nAs a consequence, we must learn how to shop, choosing the necessary food quantities, without being influenced by the offers and trying to \navoid the waste. Better to do not full to much the fridge: a full fridge consumes more! Finally, it is important to purchase bio and local products \nsupporting the virtuous economy and the short supply chain (kilometers zero). In this way, you reduce the C02 emissions due to the transfer of \nthe food products. And, if you have the fortune to have a farmer market near home, choose it instead of the supermarket! 9. Use second hand \nobjects green habits: Use second hand objects Dresses and second hand objects- picture of Our Bahcivancilar via Unsplash A smartphone, a \nvintage dress, tea and coffee dregs, an old bicycle...everything has a second life! We are in a consumeristic society: we tend to throw away what \nis broken for buying a new one. But if we adjust it instead of throw it away? The fruits dregs and vegetables can become compost for the \ngarden, an old cotton jacket an excellent dust rag. Without forgetting that several objects can be second hand purchased. 10. Prefer washable \nnappies green habits: Prefer washable nappies Do you know that the disposable nappies produce the 15% of the non recyclable waste? Besides \nthe expensive costs (approximately 1.500 € per child) they also damages the environment and irritates the skin. For this reason, if you have to \ntake care of a baby, the solution is to use washable nappies that are causing less inflammations for the child, they are ecological and reusable. \nAs last homework we have to adopt these 10 simple green habits and to share our life style with friends and parents for a more sustainable \nworld! 12 Ways to Live More Sustainably Every day we make choices in our lives that affect the environment, the climate and other species. \nFrom what we eat to how many children we decide to have, there’s a lot we can do to “choose wild” and reduce our environmental footprint to \nleave more room for wild animals and plants.

Ditch plastic and switch to reuse. Take \nextinction off your plate. Simplify the holidays. Choose organic. Ditch fast fashion and animal-based textiles. Be water wise. Drive less, drive \ngreen. Green your home. Boycott products that endanger wildlife. Fight for the right to choose when and if to start a family. Take action. Use \nyour voice. 1. Think twice before shopping. Think twice before shoppingEvery product we purchase has an environmental footprint, from the \nmaterials used to create it to the pollution emitted during manufacturing to the packaging that ends up in landfills and incinerators. Even if you \ncan recycle or compost a product at the end of its life, the upstream damage has already been done. So before you buy, ask yourself if you \nreally need it. If you do, consider buying secondhand instead of new, and look for products made from lower-impact materials and with minimal \npackaging and shipping. Learn more about the benefits of secondhand shopping. 2. Ditch plastic and switch to reuse. Ditch plastic and switch \nto reuse.Plastic never goes away. At least 14 million tons of it ends up in the ocean annually, making up 80% of all marine debris. Every year \nthousands of seabirds, sea turtles, seals and other marine mammals are killed after ingesting plastic or getting tangled up in it.

Learn more about plastics \npollution in our oceans and the problem with plastic bags. 3. Take extinction off your plate. Take extinction off your plateMeat production is one \nof the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet, responsible for massive amounts of water use, pollution, greenhouse gas \nemissions and habitat destruction. So when you choose to eat more plant-based foods and reduce your meat consumption you reduce your \nenvironmental footprint. Also, food is the single largest category of material thrown into municipal landfills. In the United States nearly 40% of \nedible food goes to waste — and all of the land, water and other natural resources that went into producing it go to waste along with it. Prevent \nfood waste with smart, planned shopping and make sure to consume what you purchase. Learn more about how to adopt an Earth-friendly diet \nand beat food waste. 4. Simplify the holidays. Simplify the holidaysHolidays, birthdays, weddings and other celebrations are often excessively \nwasteful. In December, for example, Americans create 23% more waste than in other months of the year. But it’s not just the extra trash that’s a \nproblem. All the fossil fuels, trees and other natural resources that go into producing gifts, decorations, single-use dinnerware and wrapping \npaper make our celebrations dreary for wildlife and the habitat they need to survive. But you can redefine your celebrations in ways that respect \nland, waters and wildlife. Instead of celebrating your next holiday with plastic décor, excessive gifts and single-use food and drink containers, \nyou can decorate with foraged plants, give homemade or secondhand gifts, and serve plant-based meals with reusable dinnerware. Learn more \nabout how to simplify the holidays and have more fun with less stuff. 5. Choose organic. Choose organicFrom coffee to fruit to clothing, \nchoosing organic products helps reduce your impact on wildlife and the planet. More than 2 billion pounds of pesticides are sold annually in the \nUnited States. Pesticides are pervasive in fish and wildlife habitat and threaten the survival and recovery of hundreds of federally listed species. \nPesticides also pollute the air, water and soil and contaminate the food we eat. If you garden, avoid pesticides at home by growing organically. \nBuilding wildlife habitat in your yard by growing native, pollinator-friendly plants and removing invasive species will attract beneficial insects and \nhelp keep unwanted pests away. When you choose organic, you’re keeping harmful pesticides out of our land and water, protecting farm \nworkers, vulnerable communities, wildlife and your family. Learn about how we’re fighting to stop the most toxic pesticides. 6. Ditch fast fashion \nand animal-based textiles. Ditch fast fashion and animal-based textilesFast fashion is an enormous, rapidly growing industry. The number of \nnew garments made per year has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, and our global consumption of fashion has increased by 400%. The \nfast fashion industry is a significant contributor to the climate crisis, responsible for as much as 10% of global carbon emissions. Animal-based \ntextiles like wool are responsible for water pollution, widespread habitat loss from deforestation, and other harms to wildlife. Slow down your \nfashion by caring for your clothes, repairing when possible and, when you need new clothes, shop secondhand or join clothing swaps. If you \nmust buy new, look past the greenwashing and purchase clothing made of truly sustainable materials like organic cotton or Tencel from brands \nthat are made to last. Read about greenwashing of the wool industry and the harms of fast fashion. 7. Be water wise. Be water wiseWater \nconservation is critical as our growing population puts increased demand on the nation’s water sources and we face unprecedented droughts. \nYou can conserve water by taking shorter showers, fixing leaky toilets, and choosing low-flow and low-water appliance options. Consider \nxeriscaping your yard, a landscaping technique that uses native, drought-adapted plants that require less water and maintenance over time and \nprovide habitat and food for birds and bees. Also, one of the biggest water hogs is animal agriculture, so shifting your diet away from meat and ","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/4LMAjbRuwW.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.3","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"pdfmake","Producer":"pdfmake","CreationDate":"D:20241109123443Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":7},"loc":{"pageNumber":5}}}],["269a9e26-6d54-4c75-b776-4ee2072f82b8",{"pageContent":"dairy products saves water too.

Drive less, drive greenFossil-\nfueled transportation emissions create greenhouse gases, smog, soot and other harmful air pollution. But changing your driving habits can \ndramatically reduce your carbon footprint. Walk, bike, carpool, use public transportation or join ride or bike shares whenever possible. Combine \nerrands to make fewer trips. Participate in, or start, car-free days in your community. Ask your local officials to invest in electric vehicle fleets \nand charging stations, and if you’re in the market for a new car, consider buying electric. It’s also important to keep your car in shape with \nregular tune-ups and tire inflations. Tune-ups can increase your fuel efficiency — a tire that is 20% underinflated can increase a vehicle’s fuel \nconsumption by 10%. Learn more about transportation and global warming. 9. Green your home. Green your homeJust as keeping your car in \nshape improves your fuel efficiency, keeping your home in shape improves your energy efficiency. Make sure your home has adequate \ninsulation and energy-saving windows and use a programmable thermostat for more efficient heating and cooling — and, of course, energy-\nsaving lightbulbs for more efficient lighting. If your state allows you to pick your electricity supplier, use a company that generates at least half \nof its power from wind, solar and other clean sources. Installing rooftop solar panels or solar water heating also helps the planet and can save \nyou money. Many states now offer incentives to help you green your home or rental at low or no cost. Call your energy provider to see if it offers \nfree energy audits or knows of a company that does. Learn how to keep cool without the climate cost and weatherize for wildlife. 10. Boycott \nproducts that endanger wildlife. Boycott products that endanger wildlifeProducts made from animals on the endangered species list are illegal \nto buy, sell, import or trade in the United States, but if a plant or animal hasn’t been listed yet, they can still be harmed for someone’s profit. Also, \nsome products harm endangered species by threatening their habitat, from cutting down old-growth forests to using up the water that riparian \nspecies need to survive. To avoid contributing to the endangerment of wildlife, shop conscientiously and look for products made from \nsustainable materials like bamboo and dine at restaurants that refuse to serve imperiled species like bluefin tuna. Join the Bluefin Boycott and \nlearn more about how the world comes together to tackle wildlife trade. 11. Fight for the right to choose when and if to start a family. Fight for \nthe right to choose when and if to start a familyWith more than 8 billion people in the world our demands for food, water, land and fossil fuels \nare pushing other species to extinction. Human population growth and consumption are at the root of our most pressing environmental crises, \nbut they’re often left out of the conversation. By advancing reproductive health, rights and justice and gender equity, we can improve the health \nof people and the planet because better education and access to family-planning services decreases family size and our overall carbon \nfootprint. Get the conversation started by talking about family planning with your partner. In your community, stand up for reproductive freedom \nby supporting comprehensive sex ed in schools, free and easily accessible contraception and abortion access. Learn more about human \npopulation growth and overconsumption and sign up to distribute our endangered species condoms. 12. Take action. Use your voice. Take \naction, Use your voiceOne of the best things you can do for wildlife and the planet, today and for the future, is to get politically involved in your \ncommunity and at the national level. Vote for candidates with strong environmental platforms. Urge your representatives to pass stronger \npolicies to limit greenhouse gases, fight climate change, protect wildlife and public lands and support access to reproductive health services. \nVote with your wallet by donating to organizations fighting to end the extinction crisis. Sign and share action alerts, attend events, and talk to \nyour friends about endangered species protection and the need to address human population growth and overconsumption.

These things include \nwater,  land,  soils,  rocks,  forests,  animals,  fossil  fuels  \nand minerals. They are called natural resources as they \nare the basis of life on earth. We use these resources to \nsurvive and also to function properly. Natural resources \ncan  be  consumed  directly  or  indirectly.

The \nresources, which have been developed by human beings \nduring  the  growth  of  civilisation,  are  called  artificial \nresources.  For  example,  biogas,  thermal  electricity,  \nplastics, etc.\nNatural resources come in many forms. It may be a \nsolid, liquid or gas. It may also be organic or inorganic. \nIt may also be metallic or non-metallic. \n(i) Land Resources: Human beings thus, use land \nas a resource for production as well as residence \nand recreation. It is a finite resource which is \nsubject to agricultural and non-agricultural uses, \nsuch as infrastructure development.\n(ii) Forest  Resources:  A  forest  is  a  natural,  self-\nsustaining  community  characterised  by  vertical  \nstructure  created  by  presence  of  trees.  Wood  is  \nused for making furniture, tool-handles, railway \nsleepers,  matches,  ploughs,  bridges,  boats,  etc.  \nand  as  a  source  of  energy  for  cooking  purpose  \nand  for  keeping  warm.

There are 5 \nfundamental sources of energy: (i) Nuclear fusion \nin  the  Sun  (solar  energy),  (ii)  Gravity  generated  \nby  the  Earth  and  Moon,  (iii)  Nuclear  fission \nreactions, (iv) Energy in the interior of the Earth, \nand (v) Energy stored in chemical bonds. Most of \nthe  energy  we  use  today  come  from  fossil  fuels  \n(stored  solar  energy).  But  fossils  fuels  have  a  \ndisadvantage in that they are non-renewable on \na human time scale, and causes other potentially \nharmful effects on the environment.\nNatural   resources   fall   under   the   following   main   \ncategories:\n(a)\n Inexhaustible \nResources:   The   resources   which   \ncannot be exhausted by human consumption are called \ninexhaustible resources. These include energy sources \nlike solar radiation, wind power, water power and tidal \npower, etc.\n(b)\n Exhaustible Resources: There are some resources, \nwhich are available in limited quantities and are going \nto  be  exhausted  as  a  result  of  continuous  use.  For  \nexample,  the  stock  of  coal  in  the  earth  is  limited  and  \none day there will be no more coal available for our use, \nif we keep on using it excessively. \n(c)\n Renewable Resources: Renewable  resources  are  \nthose that are constantly available (like water) or can be \nreasonably replaced or recovered, like vegetative lands \n(Table 5.1).

But if forest is totally cut down to get land \nfor construction of buildings, it is lost forever. \nRenewable  energy  systems  use  resources  that  are  \nconstantly  replaced  and  are  usually  less  polluting.  \nExamples   include   hydropower,   solar,   wind,   and   \ngeothermal (energy from the heat inside the earth). \n(d) Non-renewable Resources: Non-renewable resources \nare  those  that  cannot  easily  be  replaced  once  they  are  \ndestroyed (Table 5.1). For example, fossil fuels. Minerals \nare  also  non-renewable  because  even  though  they  \nform naturally in a process called the rock cycle, it can  \ntake  thousands  of  years,  making  it  non-renewable.   \nNon-renewable   resources   can   be   called   inorganic   \nresources  if  they  come  from  non-living  things.

Energy  from  rivers  is  used  to  make  \nelectricity. Energy produced by tides in sea and \noceans can also be converted\n into electricity.\nPetroleum\nIt  includes  petrol,  diesel  and  mineral  \noils.  It  is  used  to  run  motor  vehicles,  \nfurnaces and power-houses.\nSun\nSun’s energy can be used to generate electricity. \nThese  are  used  in  calculators,  street  lamps,  \nand even in room heaters and water heaters.\nUnit 5.indd   16724-08-2018   16:40:38","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":5}}}],["d00121ee-87b4-421d-94b9-71afb666ae11",{"pageContent":"Employability SkillS – ClaSS iX\n168\nLPG\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is made \nfrom  petroleum  gas.

Pollution is caused by pollutants, \nwhich may be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature. \nPollution  is  the  effect  of  undesirable  changes  in  \nour  surroundings  that  have  harmful  effects  on  \nplants,  animals  and  human  beings.  Pollutants  \nare  produced  due  to  human  activity,  which  \nhave  a  detrimental  effect  on  our  environment.\nFor  example,  factories  consume  a  lot  of  water  \nand  electricity  and  release  harmful  chemicals  \nin  air,  land  and  water,  thus  contaminating  the  \natmosphere. Water pollution caused by factories \nand  other  industries  can  be  the  most  serious  \nproblem. They also pollute the air through fossil \nfuel  emissions.  These  emissions  include  carbon  \ndioxide,  methane,  and  nitrous  oxide,  which  are  \nharmful to the living beings. \nnoteS\nUnit 5.indd   16924-08-2018   16:40:38","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["c0e25a27-c3e2-459b-8452-b9d6b8be40ba",{"pageContent":"Employability SkillS – ClaSS iX\n170\nPollutants are of two types, as described in Table 5.2.\nSome of the other factors responsible for polluting the \nenvironment are as follows:\n• Exhaust  fumes  released  from  vehicle  pollutes  \nthe air.\n•\n Excessive  use  of  chemicals  in  agriculture  (like  \ninsecticides  and  fertil\nisers)  affect  the  alkailinity  \nof the soil or the soil pH.

Have  you  felt  that  it  is  much  \nhotter inside a closed vehicle because the heated air is \nblocked inside? Similarly, the earth is becoming hotter \nbecause of burning fossil fuels (coal, petrol, diesel, etc.). \nThese  gases  trap  and  prevent  the  earth’s  heat  from  \nescaping, leading to a global warming. This is called the \n“greenhouse effect”.\nForests are the main mechanism for the conversion \nof  carbon  dioxide  into  carbon  and  oxygen.  The  loss  \nof  forest  cover,  coupled  with  the  increasing  release  of  \ncarbon dioxide and other gases through industrialization \ncontributes to the ‘greenhouse effect’. Some greenhouse \ngases  occur  naturally  and  enter  the  atmosphere  as  a  \nresult of both natural processes (such as decomposition \nof organic matter) and human activity (such as burning \nfossil fuels and agriculture). \nGreenhouse  gases  that  occur  both  naturally  and  \nfrom  human  activities  include  water  vapour,  carbon  \ndioxide  (CO\n2\n),  methane  (CH\n4\n),  nitrous  oxide  (N\n2\nO)  and  \nozone (O\n3\n). Other greenhouse gases have essentially no \nnatural sources, but are the side products of industrial \nprocesses   or   manufactured   for   human   purposes,   \nsuch  as  cleaning  agents,  refrigerants,  and  electrical  \ninsulators.   These   include   the   fluorinated  gases: \nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydro chlorofluorocarbons \n(HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs). This greenhouse \neffect causes snow to melt very fast. \nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from \nburning  oil,  coal  and  gas  for  energy  use  is  a  serious  \nproblem  as  it  is  harmful  to  the  environment.  Carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 31% since \npre-industrial  times,  causing  more  heat  to  be  trapped  \nin the lower atmosphere. As a result, there are frequent \nfloods  and  changes  in  climate  as  well  as  damage  to \ncrops and animal life.\nHarmful radiation\nYou might be knowing that the atmosphere protects us \nfrom harmful radiation from the sun.

It  is  a  \nconcept of the modern waste management.\nReduce: Do not use what you do not need. If we reduce at \nsource, there is a lesser chance of waste generation and \nthe pressure on our already stretched natural resources \nis reduced. On an individual level we can reduce the use \nof  unnecessary  items  while  shopping,  buy  items  with  \nminimal packaging, avoid buying disposable items and \nalso avoid asking for plastic carry bags. Use your own \nreusable cloth or jute bags instead of plastic bags. \nReuse: Reuse the materials for other purposes, such \nas making pillow covers or rags out of used shirts or \nladies suits. \nRecycling: Recycling is reusing some components of the \nwaste  that  may  have  some  economic  value.  Recycling  \nhas  readily  visible  benefits,  such  as  conservation  of \nresources reduction in energy used during manufacture \nand  reducing  pollution  levels.  Some  materials,  such  \nas  aluminum  and  steel  can  be  recycled  many  times.  \nMetal, paper, glass and plastics are recyclable. Plastic \nitems  are  recycled  into  new  plastic  products.  Kitchen  \nwet  waste  can  be  utilised  to  make  compost  that  can  \nbe used as an organic fertiliser. To do this every house \nshould  segregate  the  waste  into  wet  and  dry  garbage.  \nWet garbage includes most kitchen wastes, which can \nbe used for preparing vermicompost. Most dry garbage \nis   recyclable.   Several   technological   breakthroughs   \nhave  recently  been  made  to  recover  material  from  \nindustrial   waste.

Conservation \nis  the  proper  management  of  a  natural  resource  to  \nprevent  its  exploitation,  destruction  or  degradation.  \nConservation  is  the  sum  total  of  activities,  which  \ncan derive benefits from natural resources but at the \nsame  time  prevent  excessive  use,  which  may  lead  to  \ndestruction or degradation. It means using them more \nefficiently and less wastefully. \nAs a first step, we can conduct the resource audit \nto  examine  the  consumption  of  the  resources  and  \naccordingly   take   measures   to   conserve   them.   For   \nexample, for an energy use audit, we can examine the \nuse of the air conditioning system, ventilation system, \nlight system and entry of sunlight into the room or the \nbuilding.  We can plan energy saving measures, such as \ncleaning the dust from the tubelights to get more light, \nregular servicing and maintenance of home appliances \nand  switching  off  lights  and  devices  when  not  in  use,  \netc. to conserve energy. Energy conservation also help \nin saving fossil fuel and money.  \nSoil conservation\nSoil  conservation  means  checking  soil  erosion  and  \nimproving  soil  fertility  by  adopting  various  methods.  \nSoil conservation can be useful for the following: \n1.\n Maintenance  of  soil  fertility:  The  fertility  \ncan  be  \nmaintained  by  adding  manure  and  fertilizers  \nregularly as well as by rotation of crop. \n2.\n Control  on  grazing:  Grazing  should  be  allowed  \nonly on specified areas. \n3.\n Reforestation:  Planting  of  trees  and  vegetation  \nreduces soil erosion. \n4. Terracing: Dividing \na slope into several flat fields \nto control rapid run of water. It is practised mostly \nin hilly areas. \n5. Contour  ploughing:  Ploughing  at  right  angles  to  \nthe  slope  \nallows  the  furrows  to  trap  water  and  \ncheck soil erosion by rain water.\nnoteS\nUnit 5.indd   17824-08-2018   16:40:39","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":16}}}],["f99eaa4b-ea8b-4b92-adb9-4865a08873dc",{"pageContent":"Green SkillS\n179\nWater conservation\nConservation  and  management  of  water  are  essential  \nfor  the  survival  of  mankind,  plants  and  animals.  This  \ncan be achieved by adopting the following methods: \n1. Growing vegetation in the catchment areas, which \nwill hold water in the soil and allow it to percolate \ninto deeper layers and contribute to formation of \nground water. \n2.\n Constructing  dams  and  reservoirs  to  regulate  \nsupply of water to the fields, as well as to enable \ngeneration of hydroelectricity. \n3.\n Sewage should be treated and only the clear water \nshould be released into the rivers. \n4. Industrial wastes (effluents) should be treated \nto  prevent  chemical  and  thermal  pollution  of  \nfresh water. \n5.\n Judicious use of water in our day-to-day life. \n6. Rainwater  harvesting  should  be  done  by  storing  \nrainwater and recharging groundwater.\n7.\n Watershed, which is a single unit of land with its \nwater  \ndrainage  system  includes  soil  and  water  \nmanagement  for  developing  vegetative  cover  in  \nthe area. \nEnergy conservation\nWe use a lot of non-renewable energy resource for our \nneeds. Since resources are limited, we need to conserve \nthem as much as possible. Conservation of resources or \nenergy means saving them and using them efficiently. \nCan  you  think  of  ways  to  save  the  natural  resources?  \nSome ideas have been given here in table 5.6.\nTable 5.6: Ways of Conserving Energy\n• Switch off lights, fans, TV and other electrical items, when not in use\n• Use tube lights and energy efficient bulbs that save energy rather than bulbs. \n• Keep the bulbs and tubes clean. \n• Remove dust on the tubes and bulbs to improve lighting levels by 10 to 20%. \n•\n Use pressure cooker to save energy required for cooking. \n• Keep vessels covered with a lid during cooking. It is useful in cooking the food faster \nand saving energy.\n• Electric items like air conditioners geysers, heaters and dryers use a lot  of electrical \npower. Use them when necessary.\nUnit 5.indd   17924-08-2018   16:40:39","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":17}}}],["2e110188-6bbf-4f82-97cf-c1d016a7826b",{"pageContent":"Employability SkillS – ClaSS iX\n180\nThe  teacher  will  facilitate  these  activities  and  give  additional  \nfeedback and summarise for the students as needed.\nActivity 1\nConserving natural resources\nMaterial required\nPen, notebook, chart paper, colours, crayons etc.\nProcedure\n•\tForm a group with four students in each group.\n•\tMake a list of all the energy or natural resources you use \nin a day, such as petrol or diesel for coming to school in a \nbus, electricity for light, etc. Then make a list of how you \ncan reduce the amount of resources in each step. \n•\tMake  a  poster  on  ‘Conserving  the  Environment’.

With increasing population \nand  income,  the  consumption  of  goods  is  increasing  \nday by day. This has led to increase in production and \nutilization  of  natural  resources,  which  are  required  \nfor  producing  goods.  Society  must  thus  change  its  \nunsustainable development strategy to a new form where \ndevelopment will not destroy the environment. This form \nof  sustainable  development  can  only  be  brought  about  \nif each individual practices a sustainable lifestyle.

Sustainable  development  is  \ndefined as ‘development that meets the needs of the \npresent  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future  \ngenerations to meet their own needs’ (World Commission \non Environment and Development, 1987). For example, \nsustainable    agriculture    consists    of    environment \nfriendly  methods  of  farming  that  allow  the  production  \nof  agricultural  crops  or  livestock  without  damage  to  \nhuman or natural systems. It also involves preventing \nthe  use  of  chemicals  so  as  to  avoid  adverse  effects  to  \nsoil, water and biodiversity.\nBiological  diversity  or  biodiversity  in  short  is  that  \npart of nature which includes the differences in genes \namong  the  individuals  of  a  species,  the  variety  and  \nrichness of all the plant and animal species at different \nscales  in  space,  locally,  in  a  region,  in  the  country  \nand  the  world,  and  various  types  of  ecosystems,  both  \nterrestrial and aquatic, within a defined area. Biological \ndiversity is essential for preserving ecological processes, \nsuch as fixing and recycling of nutrients, soil formation, \ncirculation  and  cleansing  of  air  and  water,  global  life  \nsupport (plants absorb CO\n2\n , give out O\n2\n ), maintaining the \nwater balance within ecosystems, watershed protection, \nmaintaining stream and river flows throughout the year, \nerosion control and local flood reduction.\nWhat is sustainable development?\nSustainability is   the   development   that satisfies  the \nneeds of the present without compromising the capacity \nnoteS\nUnit 5.indd   18224-08-2018   16:40:39","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":20}}}],["2642416e-11af-4040-b5ab-4a13d515e213",{"pageContent":"Green SkillS\n183\nof future generations, guaranteeing the balance between \neconomic  growth,  care  for  the  environment  and  social  \nwell-being.

Using   \naerobic  bacteria,  this  tank  converts  \nhuman     waste     into     environment     \nstandard  compatible  water,  which  is  \nused for flushing, or even for irrigation. \nGreen benefits \n•\n Water conservation due to less flushing\n•\n Efficient sewage system\n•\n Decrease in soil and water contamination\n• Decrease in diseases due to hygienic sanitation.\nUnit 5.indd   19224-08-2018   16:40:41","metadata":{"source":"/home/thebearguy/Desktop/This-is-Shreyansh/Projects/fockit/assets/dataset/ncert_eco.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","CreationDate":"D:20180824164038+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20210929152453+05'30'","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2021-09-29T15:24:53+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4c3cb2c-c5d5-41b2-9e58-844cf5a68ebf","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562C","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:08C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:07C73A4D8EA7E8118F6ACB93B98AC4D0xmp.did:9C914410C1A6E811B0F6A94552577D9Axmp.did:71640CFE67F3E6119306C8311DE9562Cdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)/2018-08-24T16:40:38+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":31},"loc":{"pageNumber":30}}}],["ddd2a538-c217-4f92-a609-05c63543e90b",{"pageContent":"Green SkillS\n193\nActivity 1\nImportance of Green Skills\nProcedure\n• Form groups of 3–4 people in each group.\n• Within your group, discuss the importance of green skills \nand their role in making a green economy. \n• One  volunteer  group  explains  the  importance  of  green  \nskills and a green economy to the rest of the class. \nActivity 2\nImportance of green economy\nMaterials required\nPen, chart paper, colours, crayons\nProcedure\n1.\n Keep the same group as the previous activity. \n2.\n Make a poster on ‘Importance of a Green Economy’ using \nthe \npoints from your previous discussion.
